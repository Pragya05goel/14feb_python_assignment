    "Multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses of multithreading are:\n",
    "\n",
    ". It ensures effective utilization of computer system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Multithreaded applications are more responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It shares resources and its state with sub-threads (child) which makes it more economical.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It makes the multiprocessor architecture more effective due to similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It saves time by executing multiple threads at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    ". The system does not require too much memory to store multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Responsiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in an interactive application enables a program to continue running even if a section is blocked or executing a lengthy process, increasing user responsiveness.\n",

    "2.Resource Sharing:\n",

    ". Message Passing\n",
    ". Shared Memory\n",

    "Allocating memory and resources for process creation is an expensive procedure because it is a time and space-consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of multi-programming become much more apparent in the case of multiprocessor architecture, when threads may execute in parallel on many processors. When there is just one thread, it is impossible to break the processes into smaller jobs performed by different processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Minimized system resource usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads have a minimal influence on the system's resources. The overhead of creating, maintaining, and managing threads is lower than a general process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Utilization of multiprocessor architecture:\n",

    "The advantages of multithreading might be considerably amplified in a multiprocessor architecture, where every thread could execute in parallel on a distinct processor.\n",

    "Disadvantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    ". It needs more careful synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It can consume a large space of stocks of blocked threads.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It needs support for thread or process.\n",

    ". If a parent process has several threads for proper process functioning, the child processes should also be multithreaded because they may be required.\n",
